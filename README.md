## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Figma
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

Flex-grow is my friend!!!

### Continued development

Sizing the text so that it matches the copy, I need to add a media query since there is a slight font size difference bettween desktop and mobile, hence why the copy isnt laid out the same. Was going to do ``&nbsp;`` but decided to just focus on submitting something with a time constraint i set for myself. 

### Useful resources

before i just decided to use rbga cause it was provided in the figma file. 
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3212459/is-there-a-command-to-undo-git-init)
there was an older repo that the file was connected to instead of making changes to it i wanted to scrap it all together. so to keep everything in order i just removed this folder from git and reinitialized it.
